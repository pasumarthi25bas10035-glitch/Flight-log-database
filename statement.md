# Project Statement – Flight Log Database

## Problem Statement
Flight information such as pilot details, aircraft records, and flight schedules is often stored manually or in unorganized formats, causing data inconsistency, difficulty in searching, and higher chances of error. A centralized system is required to manage this data efficiently.

## Objective
To design and implement a simple relational database that stores and manages pilots, aircraft, and flight logs with proper relationships and constraints for accurate and easy data handling.

## Scope
- Tables for Pilots, Aircraft, and Flights  
- Use of primary keys, foreign keys, and unique constraints  
- Basic SQL operations: insert, update, delete, and select for flight-related data  

## Expected Outcome
A working database that can reliably store and retrieve flight log information, reduce manual errors, and serve as a base for future enhancements like reports and web interfaces.
